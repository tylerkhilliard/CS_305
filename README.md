Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Our Client was Artemis Financial and they were wanting to add file verification to web applications for secure communication. They wanted a secure and proper way to transfer data and needed quality in the code. Able to understand and use the code.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I believe I was able to find the vulnerabilities in the code and address them . Secure coding can help protect sensitive data, such as financial information and customerPII, from being stolen or misused. There are a number of secure coding standards and guidelines available, such as the OWASP Secure Coding Practices. These standards and guidelines can help developers write secure code.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The environment I was trying to run the code in gave me issues. I had some software conflictions that were causing Java to misbehave and not act correctly.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
We used checksum and certificates. Checksum for the encryption of the data and the certificates to verify to the user that we have a trusted site.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
We used best practices and referenced CISA to avoid using any vulnerable plugins and code. We used the Maven checker to verify our code had no new vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I learned to rely on my peers on Github or other sites that I can reference code to and from. 99.99% of the time another user has encountered an issue I am running into and they found an issue.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I'll show how we successfully implemented Checksum and the certificates. We can verify our code has no vulnerabilities through the Maven tool and we are used to making changes to resolve those vulnerabilities.
